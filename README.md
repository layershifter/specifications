# Stardust UI Design Specifications

These specifications cover component names and anatomy.

For each component spec:

What are the naming conventions
What the states

# Process in how we develop a specification

1. Collect examples
2. Collect terminology
3. Agree on standard taxonomy
4. Design reviews?

# Enforcing the specification

It is important that we validate the taxonomy in new components as they come online, automatically.

4. Automate validation of taxonomy
